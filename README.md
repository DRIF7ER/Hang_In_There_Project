# Hang in There  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
We built the functionality to handle all the click events in the "Hang in there" motivational poster application. We created functionality to handle click events to switch between each page as well as a save poster button that saves the current poster displayed on the main page. We also created the functionality to handle creating a random motivational poster as well as a the function to submit the form to fill out with an image a title and quote inout to create your own with the click of a button.
Finally we added the ability to delete any poster from the saved posters page by double clicking the photo you wish to delete.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Write clean, DRY JavaScript
Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP
Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
Begin to understand the connection between HTML, CSS and JavaScript
Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
Build an understanding of writing code collaboratively
Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team
Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project

We used/added JavaScript to make the static Html and css page functional.
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
We established a solid github workflow and really starting to understand how the flow works and fix issues using git commands. We also psuedocoded really well when creatiing each function. A challenge we faced was managing all the variables for the query selectors and event listeners.
